## Lexical Analyser

This is a lexical analyser generated by Flex for a pascal-like language grammar. 

## How to use

Just run "./lexer.exe {file_name}.txt" into the project folder or build the "lex.yy.c" file with "g++ lex.yy.c -o lexer.exe" then run "./lexer.exe {file_name}.txt".

It will save all the identified tokens into an array then print them. It will also generate an output file wich may serve for didatic purposes
